- [x] No PII stored in plaintext (hashed identifiers)

### SQL Injection Prevention
- [x] Using SQLAlchemy ORM (parameterized queries)
- [x] No raw SQL with string concatenation
- [x] Input validation with Pydantic

## üåê Network Security

### HTTPS/TLS
- [ ] Use HTTPS in production (required)
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ only
- [ ] Valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Certificate auto-renewal (Let's Encrypt)

### Firewall & Access
- [ ] Firewall configured on production server
- [ ] Only necessary ports exposed (443, 80)
- [ ] SSH key-based authentication (no passwords)

- [ ] Log rotation configured
- [ ] Secure log storage (encrypted, access-controlled)

## üõ°Ô∏è Dependency Security

### Dependency Management
- [x] Dependencies pinned in requirements.txt
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Automated security scanning (GitHub Dependabot)
- [ ] SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation

### Vulnerability Scanning
- [x] Safety for Python dependencies
- [x] Bandit for SAST (Static Application Security Testing)
- [ ] Regular security audits
- [ ] Penetration testing before production

## üö® Incident Response

### Kill Switch
- [x] Kill switch flag implemented
- [x] Can pause operations remotely
- [ ] Admin notification on kill switch activation
- [ ] Documented procedure for emergencies

### Backup & Recovery
- [ ] Daily automated backups
- [ ] Backup encryption
- [ ] Offsite backup storage
- [ ] Tested recovery procedure
- [ ] DR (Disaster Recovery) plan documented

### Incident Handling
- [ ] Incident response plan (TODO: in operations runbook)
- [ ] Contact list for security incidents
- [ ] Post-incident review process
- [ ] Breach notification procedure (LGPD compliance)

## üîÑ Security Best Practices

### Code Security
- [x] Code review required for all changes
- [x] No debugging endpoints in production
- [ ] Security linting in CI/CD
- [ ] Regular security training for developers

### Third-Party Services
- [ ] Vet all third-party services for security
- [ ] Minimal permissions for integrations
- [ ] Regular audit of third-party access
- [ ] DPA (Data Processing Agreement) for processors

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Separate production environment
- [ ] No direct production access (use CI/CD)
- [ ] Immutable infrastructure
- [ ] Blue-green or canary deployments

## üìã Security Testing

### Pre-Production
- [x] Unit tests include security scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flows
- [ ] E2E tests with security checks
- [ ] Load testing with security monitoring

### Production
- [ ] Continuous security scanning
- [ ] Regular penetration testing
